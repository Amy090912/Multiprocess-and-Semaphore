# Multiprocess-and-Semaphore

A model of Smaug's world with multiprocess. 
Smaug is a process, each treasure hunter is a process and each thief is a process. 
Thieves travel to Smaug's valley at random time, and play game with Smaug.
Treasure hunters arrive at random intervals drawn from a uniform distribution.
The Smaug defeats the thieves and treasure hunters with a given win probability.
